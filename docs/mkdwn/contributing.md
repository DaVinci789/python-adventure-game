# Style Guidelines

Most of the guidelines here are very similar to PEP 8

Nevertheless, here's a quick run down.

- Spaces, not tabs
	- 4 space indentation

- 80 column limit on lines
	- If necessary, 90 to 100 is acceptable


# Contributing

- Pull requests are recommended, but patches are okay.

- When adding a change to a module, make sure to run the appropriate test.

``` python
# Example
$ python3 -m unittest src/tests/test_unittestname
```
