Dear bloody pea--I mean subject,
This area has been troubled with all sorts of monsters lately--orcs,
large spiders, ghosts, and other foul creatures. If you would be so kind
as to assist in their destruction, you could be handsomely rewarded. Of
significant note is the robbery of the beloved and most holy Grail. If
you were to recover it, I, Arthur, King of the Britons, would give you
full command of the land of Camelot and all resources within it,
including all of the ham, jam, and spam that is so dear to the knights
that reside there. I will be excited to be rid of that ridi--I mean,
I hope this incentive will help motivate you peasants to follow my
orders. Oh--yes, did I mention that any person found not hunting these
abominations will be executed? I am your King, you see.
King Arthur of the Britons
